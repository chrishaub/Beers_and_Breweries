# Beers and Breweries in The United States

## Introduction
Analysis was completed on two datasets for Beers and Breweries in The United States. The purpose of this project was to gain insights into beer by analyzing the two datasets that we were provided with. The variables we analyzed into gaining a better understanding of beer was the Alcohol By Volume (ABV), International Bitterness Units (IBU), style of the beer, ounces, and location of the brewery.
## Datasets
The two datasets that were used was the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv. The Brew_ID column in the Breweries.csv was changed to Brewery_id. Then a left join was completed to merge the files on Brewery_id.
## Analysis
We analyzed and provided answers to the following questions:
1.   How many breweries are present in each state?

2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  

3.   Address the missing values in each column.

4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. 

5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? 

8.   Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name        other than IPA).
